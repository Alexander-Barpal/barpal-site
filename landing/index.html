                                This project was undertaken by me and a coworker, 
                            our goal for this project was to us UIPath to automate what 
                            would otherwise be a time-consuming manual task.
                            The manual task that we were working to automate took around 5
                            minutes and 20 steps spread across multiple websites, as this task
                            needed to be preformed around 10,000 times it was infeasable to preform
                            by hand with just the two of us. Our tight deadline meant that we needed to complete this project as fast as possible
                            which lead to some difficult design requirements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The Automation solution we arrived at consisted of several different automation programs each designed
                            to handle one section of the manual task. We deciced to break the automation up in to multiple parts becuase despite our ability to create a single program to handle the entire process
                            one our main goals was to save time so as to meet our deadline and we discoved that repeating certains steps of the process on many items at once was significantly faster
                            than doing every step for each item before moving on to the next. We also ended up seperating ech section into its own program so as to save time on troubleshooting the many
                            issues of a creating a larger program as well as to make each program easier to manual stop or start.
