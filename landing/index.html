                            <h2>UIPath Automation</h2>
                            <p>
                            This project was undertaken by me and a coworker, 
                            our goal for this project was to us UIPath to automate what 
                            would otherwise be a time-consuming manual task.
                            The manual task that we were working to automate took around 5
                            minutes and 20 steps spread across multiple websites, as this task
                            needed to be preformed around 10,000 times it was infeasable to preform
                            by hand with just the two of us. Our tight deadline meant that we needed
                            to complete this project as fast as possible
                            which lead to some difficult design requirements.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                                The Automation solution we arrived at consisted of several different automation programs each designed
                            to handle one section of the manual task. We deciced to break the automation up in to multiple parts becuase 
                            despite our ability to create a single program to handle the entire process
                            one our main goals was to save time so as to meet our deadline and we discoved that repeating certains steps 
                            of the process on many items at once was significantly faster than doing every step for each item before moving 
                            on to the next. We also ended up seperating ech section into its own program so as to save time on troubleshooting
                            the many issues of a creating a larger program as well as to make each program easier to manual stop or start.

                        <p>
                            I started this project becuase I needed a portfolio and decided that I want to build my own from scratch to 
                            learn more about web design and devolpment.
                        </p>

                            All html, CSS, and Javascript code was programmed by using only VS code and freely available documentation.
                            This project required me to put my Computer science skills to use and helped me improve my general programming 
                            skills as there were several challenges I encountered during the creation of this website that pushed me to improve
                            my programming skills as well as my knowledge of all three programming languages that I used for this website.

                        <h2>My background and interests</h2>
                        <p>
                            I was Born in the Bay area but have spent most of my life living in the foothills of the greater Sacramento 
                            area. My biggest interests include Music, Computers/ electronics, and Art. I have always been interested in 
                            music, having messed around with my father's guitars when I was little, I played the saxophone in my school 
                            band through both middle and high school as well as preformed with several ensembles on the side throughout 
                            the years where I picked up experience in percussion and a little in piano. I have continued my Music interests 
                            since graduating by continuing to play the saxophone in ensembles when time allows and by picking up the guitar 
                            in a casual setting. As for Computers I have always had a fascination around computers and electronics in 
                            general, from building computers and servers with my father as a child, to taking mechatronics and computer 
                            programming courses in high school, to majoring in Computer engineering in college, as well as working on 
                            several electronics projects as a hobby and working in the IT field. As for art like music I have always been 
                            interested in creative outlets although I admit I have very little skill when it comes to art, though I have 
                            had a modicum of success with design.

                        <h2>My Education and Skills</h2>
                        <p>
                            I am currently enrolled in Sacramento State as a Computer Engineering major, though I am looking at having to 
                            take a break from college due to life circumstances. I have taken many programing and computer logic courses 
                            as well as an electronic logic design course in college. While not as impressive, in high-school I took several 
                            related courses including mechatronics, computer programming, and statistics.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                        <p>
                            My first official job was an unpaid Volunteer position with my High Schools IT department, this position 
                            required me to resolve teacher requests received either via phone or our schools ticketing system, preform 
                            maintenance on various pieces of school technology, as well repair or replace broken components on both Desktop 
                            Computers and school issue Chromebooks. This position made me learn a broad range of skills and knowledge to 
                            handle the day-to-day technology requirements of the school.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            My second job and a position I am still in, is working customer service for SacAnime, a seasonal convention 
                            event. There are usually three or four conventions held a year, each convention is a weekend event in which 
                            I usually clock fifty to seventy hours. This position requires me to engage with customers to help them either 
                            buy or redeem their Event passes, as well as answering any questions about the event they may have, and in the 
                            case of an issue or complaint being brought to be handling the situation if it is within my power or escalating 
                            it to the proper department head if not. This position has me improve my customer service skills as well as my 
                            ability to interact with customers in a professional manner and remain calm in stressful or heated situations.
                        <br/>
                            My most recent Position working in IT support at Sacramento state was similar to my first job in many respects, 
                            with the most noticeable difference being the size of the operations, At my High school my department of 5 
                            managed around 100 classrooms all of which were only equipped with a single simple technology setup, meanwhile 
                            at Sacramento State my department of 10 is in charge of managing nearly 400 classrooms equipped with one of 5 
                            different AV setups, each setups consisting of at least 10 devices as opposed to the 3 or 4 of my high schools 
                            setups. This position really helped me adjust to the difficulties of being part of a large organization and all 
                            that entails, such as working with different departments, and managing a far greater range of equipment.
